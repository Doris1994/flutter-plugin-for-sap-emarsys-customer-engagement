The EmarsysSDK Flutter Plugin is the official plugin to help integrate Emarsys into your Flutter application. 
On this page we won't go into details about how the SDK works, and what the supported features can be used for.

For more detailed information about the different features please visit the [iOS](https://github.com/emartech/ios-emarsys-sdk/wiki) or the [Android](https://github.com/emartech/android-emarsys-sdk/wiki) SDK documentation.

## What is the Emarsys SDK
The Emarsys SDK enables you to use Mobile Engage and Predict in a very straightforward way. By incorporating the SDK in your app, we, among others, support you in handling credentials, API calls, tracking of opens and events as well as logins and logouts in the app.
